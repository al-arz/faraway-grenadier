# Faraway Grenadier

Yet another test assignment microgame. Cos it's fun to do them.

Hold and release a button to throw grenade.

## Build

### Dev
`npm run dev`

### Release
Windows only since build script depends on [this thing](scripts/copy_assets.bat). Why use a bundler when all I need is copying a bunch of files?

`npm run build`
